## 💻 Code Example
**Sorting by bits KATA from CodeWars:** In this kata you're expected to sort an array of 32-bit integers in ascending order of the number of on bits they have.

<pre> function sortByBit(arr) {
  const countBit = (bit) => bit.toString(2).replace(/[0]/g, "").length;
  return arr.sort((a, b) => countBit(a) === countBit(b) ? a - b : countBit(a) - countBit(b)); 
}</pre>
